1. Lack of Eyewitness Testimony:
- No one witnessed the burglary, so there is no direct evidence linking Mr. Robert to the crime.

2. No Forced Entry:
- The front door was smashed, but there is no evidence of forced entry through other windows or doors.
- This suggests that the burglar may have had a key or was familiar with the property.

3. Selective Items Stolen:
- Valuable items like electronics and jewelry were taken, but less valuable objects were left behind.
- This indicates that the burglar was targeting specific items, which may point to inside knowledge.

4. Lack of Footwear or Fingerprint Matches:
- The footprint impressions and fingerprints found at the crime scene do not match Mr. Robert's records.
- This further weakens the prosecution's case against him.

5. Alibi Defense:
- Mr. Robert has a solid alibi for the time of the burglary.
- He can provide witnesses and documentation to support his whereabouts during the incident.

6. Questionable Police Investigation:
- The police investigation seems rushed and incomplete.
- There are inconsistencies in the report, and key evidence was not properly collected or analyzed.

7. Absence of Prior Criminal Record:
- Mr. Robert has no prior criminal record, which suggests that he is not a habitual criminal.
- This supports the notion that he is being falsely accused.
